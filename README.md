##What to do before running
Install Maven and Java for your respective OS

###Windows
Good luck.
###Ubuntu
**Get Maven:** ```$ sudo apt-get install maven```

**Get Java:** follow this the instructions at this [link] (http://tipsonubuntu.com/2016/07/31/install-oracle-java-8-9-ubuntu-16-04-linux-mint-18/).

Do not know how to use Maven? Look [here] (https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html)

##How to run
To allow for easier running, simply invoke the following from your bash terminal:
```$ ./run.sh arg```

Where ```arg``` is one of the three:

1. compile: simply compiles the project

2. exec: simply runs the project

3. both: does both of the above
